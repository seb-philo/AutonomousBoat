# Autonomous Boat Electronic Design 

## Summary
This project involved the electronic design and code, as well as LabVIEW control development, of an autonomous boat, achieving 72%.

## Electronics and Code
This boat features a range of sensors including ultrasonics for collision avoidance and magnometer for bearings, to link to motors which can be manually controlled or automatically driven. The software was developed with C++.
